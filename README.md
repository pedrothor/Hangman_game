# Hangman_game
I decided to create this game to make a challange with me. Starting this game you can choose one of 3 options: Write a secret word, add a word in our database or get a random word of database. Than you can insert how many players will participate of this match. So, the players have to choose a letter and the software will advice if it's correct or not. If it's wrong, the program will add a part of the body untill all parts are placed. If all body parts are placed or somebody chose all correct letters, the game will finish and ranking is going to print in the screen.
